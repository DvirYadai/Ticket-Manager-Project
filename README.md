# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Final 2/5 - Ticket Manager

## Welcome to my ticket manager project!

In this readme i will introduce you to my project and show you the functionalities of my website.

- link to my [heroku app](https://powerful-dusk-08138.herokuapp.com/).

### It's recommended to view the website also in the mobile version, to show how responsive the website is. (I insist that you watch it!)

## How it's works.

- When you first entering the website you will see all the tickets that stored in the mongoDB database.
- You can sort the tickets by date, the default is new to old but you can change it to old to new.
- You can add new ticket buy clicking the + button in the header.
- You can search tickets by title just by typing in the search input.
- You can hide the tickets you want and than restore them by clicking the restore word in the header in each ticket.
- You can check ticket as done and undone by clicking the checkbox in each ticket.
- You can delete ticket by clicking the trash can icon in each ticket.

## Bonuses i've added

- Adding done and undone checkbox for every ticket.
- Add button to add new ticket.
- Delete button to delete ticket.
- Adding routes to the delete and add http request, and also adding tests to those routes.
- Adding custom errors to the user that indicates if the server is down or the user is disconnected from the internet.
- Adding 'Show more' option if the content of the ticket is more than 400 characters.

## Enjoy!
